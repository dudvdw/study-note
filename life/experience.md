### Learning methods:
1. The process of summarizing and absorbing knowledge will make it remembered in the mind.
Knowledge that can be remembered will quickly emerge when you encounter a problem and become the key to the solution. The brain's rate of associative reaction from memory is much higher than that through consulting materials (books, the Internet), so the more firmly the knowledge is remembered, the faster the problem can be solved.
On the other hand, the knowledge network formed by the knowledge that can be remembered can quickly associate the new knowledge with the original knowledge map through association when accepting new knowledge, digest and understand the knowledge, and expand the knowledge map.
2. To make new breakthroughs, you need to be very familiar with the knowledge system of the original field.
If you want to know how to go in the future, you must know how you got here. If you want to make new discoveries, you must understand the existing research foundation. New scientific discoveries are based on the research of predecessors. The more familiar you are with previous research, the more likely you are to make new discoveries.
3. If you want to learn more, you must be happy in learning, and the only way to do this is to work hard to learn what you are interested in.
No one has enough motivation to learn something they don't like for a long time. If you don't like a certain field, you can't keep investing time in research, and you can't be proficient in it. Feynman is telling us that if you can choose, you must learn what you like, otherwise you are likely to fail and may even become depressed.
Interests from the bottom of your heart can bring you happiness and are also the source of motivation for continuous efforts. So find an area that interests you, invest time and energy, and you can get happiness and gain knowledge and skills. Why not?

1. Never work for someone you don't want to be.

2. Don't make the same mistakes, try to make new ones.

3. Efficiency is overestimated, and rest is seriously underestimated. Without good rest, there can be no high efficiency.

4. Don't pursue better ways to complete tasks as quickly as possible, but pursue better tasks that make you don't want to stop.

5. There is no such thing as "on time", you are either late or early.

6. To answer "What do I want to do?", you need to answer "Who do I want to be?" first.

### Working methods

1. Respond to feedback on the work assigned to you by the leader in a timely manner. He does not have much time to follow up on specific issues. After you understand the problem, you need to choose one of the following solutions to inform the leader:
a. The problem has been solved
b. Propose several solutions for the leader to decide
c. The problem has been transferred to someone who can solve it
d. Due to some objective reasons, the problem cannot be solved temporarily, and a downgrade solution can be adopted

2. Trust is the premise of efficient cooperation. The first impression is very important. You must leave a reliable impression on your colleagues and leaders. You must do this
a. The promised things and deadlines must be completed (if you are not sure whether they can be completed, you might as well leave more buffer. Even if the schedule is long and it is completed on time, it is much better than a short schedule but delayed for a short time)
b. Try not to change your promises. If you have to change, please change it only once
Changing the promised things means that the early estimation is wrong. If you always change it, people will feel that you are not capable enough to handle this matter. Always deal with it with a try-it attitude. For example, if a blocking problem is estimated to be delayed for 3 days, but it turns out that it was solved in half a day, you should also understand the problem in detail and give a reply after three days, including the specific reason for the delay and the solution. If you tell people that the problem has been solved in advance after half a day, people who donâ€™t understand the situation will think you are unreliable and change the schedule at will as if you are joking. If the schedule can be changed at will, what is the point?
c. Let your leader be able to grasp the development of things and the work situation of employees
If the leader cannot grasp the development of things and your work situation, he cannot manage the team well and cannot trust you enough. Report your work to the leader more often. When you encounter a problem and are not sure how to solve it better, let him make the decision (remember to let him make the decision instead of helping you solve the problem, you can ask for resources). Let the leader be able to control the overall situation and feel that he is the leader, which is very important for strengthening trust.
d. Humbly accept suggestions or criticisms from others and make independent decisions after rational analysis
Everyone has their own interests. Sometimes the suggestions seem to be beneficial to you, but they are hidden and may be more beneficial to others in the end. You must analyze objectively and rationally to make the right decision.
3. Good interpersonal relationships are often more effective in solving problems
a. We all have feelings and emotions. Although everyone is serious and responsible, we are more inclined to cooperate with those who give you a good emotional experience and are more willing to help them solve problems.
b. Don't ignore any role, let alone offend anyone. Once negative emotions are generated, sometimes just releasing them once is enough to ruin the whole thing.
