### Background

On November of 2023, the JPY depreciated to 1 USD to 151 JPY. Because CNY didn't deprecated too much to USD as JPY, CNY reached the highest point in the last 10 years(1 CNY to 21 JPY). Many people hoarded lots of JPY waiting for appreciation or travel purpose. At the end of 2023, it was said the Bank of Japan will terminate the YCC policy and raise the benchmark interest rate. Then the JPY apprecicated from 4.85 CNY for 100 JPY to nearly 5 CNY for 100 JPY. For reducing the cost of future JPY, it seemed to be a good decision to buy some JPY. At the first day of 2024, Japan happened one earthquake and the JPY started to appreciate at first for rescue and compensation reason as people's speculation. Then, the JPY turned to depreciate from the next few days until the end of Febrary, about 4.78 CNY for 100 JPY. In order to reduce the cost of whole JPY, buying JPY at each lowest point when it continued to depreciate seemed like a smart strategy. At the beginning of March, JPY had ever appreciated to 4.89 CNY for 100 JPY which demonstrated it may appreciate to a high level. Everything was seemed as normal as usual until it came to April. The JPY depreciated quickly to 4.72, 4.68, 4.62...... Until the morning of April, 29th, it came to the lowest point 4.55 CNY for 100 JPY. It made people worry about the exchange rate of JPY. Then at about 12 p.m. the JPY turned to 4.65. At 3 p.m. it reached 4.66. Later, it went to 4.58 CNY for 100 JPY gradually. At May 1st, 4 a.m., the JPY rose to 4.68, falling to 4.63 temporarily. From then on, JPY appreciated to 4.73 at May 2nd slowly. The report of BOJ demonstrated that the twice appreciations of JPY was resulted from the intervention of BOJ costing 5.5 trillion JPY and 3.5 trillion JPY separately.


### Review 

In this case, you don't investigate the JPY exchange rate fully at first. What you know is that the JPY had been depreciating from 2019 to 2023 for 20% to CNY. You get one conclusion simply and roughly that it will appreciate in the future as the FED reduce benchmark interest rate and the Bank of Japan raise the benchmark interest rate. However, the exchange market is much more complicated than you think. The FED raised the benchmark interest rate for profound interest not just so-called inflation reason. It won't reduce the benchmark interest rate until the US gain enough yield. On the other side, the BOJ don't care about the how low the JPY exchange rate is, it focus on the inflation and economy of Japan and follow the instruction of the Japanese authority which is under the pressure of the US. In addtion, BOJ will protect the stability of the JPY exchange rate in some degree instead of maintaining it at a fixed range. 

Moreover, the high interest rate of FED and the low interest rate of BOJ form great interest margin resulting in carry trade. Many financial institution and people borrow JPY from BOJ with nearly no payment and exchange JPY to USD. Then, they deposit USD in American banks for high interest rate or buy the U.S. Treasury bond, US stocks. As more and more investors doing carry trade and shorting JPY, JPY depreciated quickly. Therefore, investors gain investion yield from the US and exchange rate yield from exchanging JPY with high exchange rate. One of the most representative investors, Warren E. Buffett, published JPY bond and invested the five giant companies in Japan. On one hand, he pushed the price of stocks to the highest level during the past 35 years. On the other hand, Warren Buffett can use less USD to pay for his due JPY bond with high exchange rate to JPY or pay for the due JPY bond by the JPY exchanging from new JPY bond. When the stock price reaches the peak, he sells his stocks and gain lots of JPY. Next, he will use these JPY to pay the due JYP bond and wait for the FED reducing the interest rate. 

When the Japanese stock bubble explodes, the JPY depreciates to the lowest point. As FED reducing the interest rate, BOJ may increase the interest rate to make the JPY appreciate. 

### Investment Strategy

#### Risk and Yield

When you invest in one field, you have to notice the risk and yield of the investment. As we have learned before, investment decision involves:

1. What investments should make, which means you should choose one thing or field after fully investigating.
People can not win money out of his cognition.

2. How should it pay for those investments, which means your cost and risk.

Only after these 2 procedures, you can start to think about investing with your strategy. 

People always notice the yield of one investment but ignoring the risk of it. Some one may gain generous yield with good luck, however, most people will undertake huge loss of money because of falling into the risk they had not seen before.


#### Refuse High Yield With High Risk

There is no free lunch in the world. If you want to gain more, you have to invest more, which denotes you may lose more. The easiest way to gain money is the easiest way to lose money. Similarly, the easiest way to get joy is the easiest way to fall into pain. Therefore, stay away to stock, fund, gamble, drug... which will bring you to terrible abyss. When you have experienced win lots of money in short time, you are reluctant to work hard to gain salary. When you feel money is just a series of number, you will not cherish them any more.

Don't bet for a high yield! It means you do not cherish your resources and you will lose them easily. If you cherish and love your resources, you should defend them firmly instead of put them at a risky field.

You should use your leisure money to invest on your project rather than the money you should use on your daily life. Don't borrow large amount of money on the project which has huge latent risk. It may bring you to the abyss which you can not get out again. In some financial investment area, such as exchange market, futures market, virtual currency market, real estate market, many investors choose to use high leverage ratio to bet for high yield, whereas that always results in great loss because of high financial risk.


#### Protect Your Resources

When you respect and protect your resources, you will own it for a long term. You must hold the market in awe and recognise your weakness and shortcomings so that you can make decisions carefully and reduce the risk of it. 

In addtion, the financial market is more complicated than people think. The trend of market is dominated by banker who has large amount of resources. When your investment strategy is in the same direction of the banker, you will earn some money. On the contrary, you will lose lots of money. Besides, the banker will set some trap to seduce individual investor to bet for high yield. 

Don't be too confident to your ability! You are too weak, silly, greedy than you think in the financial market. Just take care of your resources in hand. 

The most important thing is to protect your principal which is the bottom line of investment. If you can not guarantee it, you should give up this investment.


#### Deal With Risk

Involving in risk of great loss is a terrible experience which probably make you feel anxious, painful and regretful. Anxiety and worry fill in your whole life so that you can not focus on other things any more. You can not concentrate on your job, even eat well or sleep well.  If you do no want to suffer this kind of feelings again, please stay away from investment project with great risk.

When you find you are taking the risk of losing your resources, what should you do? Evaluate current loss and the risk of each decision. If the risk of future loss is out of your ability, you have to address the risk and stop the project right now although you have to bear great loss as cutting your body. You should know that take the responsibility and loss now is the best way to avoid huge loss in the future.

Do not try to gain what you have lost! That will affect your mind and lead to making decision blindly without considering the risk of it. Eventually, as you break your rule, you will lose more than you can afford. You should know the fact that life is not always full of luck and win, we often have to suffer from adversity and loss. When you come across great loss, you should stop losing more immediately and create new value rather than immersing in the pain of great loss.

Uncertain yield always has higher yield interest than certain yield, the risk of it is higher correspondingly. Uncertain yield in the future has its cost, which means you may lose money rather than gaining yield. If you don't want to lose money, you should abandon expectation and uncertain yield in the future.

Build your system of investment strategy, you must obey each rule of this system which will protect your resources. 

Try your best to create authentic value which can meet people's demands or solve their problems instead of participating in financial game to make quick money benefiting yourself only.
