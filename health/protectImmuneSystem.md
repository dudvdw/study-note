《The famous doctor teaches you to improve your immunity》

### Dangerous signs of imbalanced immune system

1. Feeling powerless to do things and having a mental breakdown for no reason (heart)
The cause is excessive stress, which leads to excessive secretion of cortisol to fight stress. Excessive cortisol levels will cause low immunity, which in turn affects the physical condition.
- Lower your expectations, reduce stress, stay away from people and things that affect your mood, and maintain a good attitude. Be grateful for the resources you have and actively create a sense of happiness.

2. Poor skin
The skin is the first line of defense of the human immune system. When the skin deteriorates and skin care products do not work, it means that there is a problem with the immune system.
- Keep a regular schedule (rest)

3. Continuous inflammation such as shoulder and neck pain
Maintaining the same posture for a long time, tension and fear will cause muscle stiffness, poor blood circulation, and the inability to transport nutrients and metabolic waste normally. A large amount of lactic acid and metabolic waste accumulate in the muscles, causing muscle soreness. Long-term neck and shoulder pain that cannot be eliminated by stretching indicates a chronic inflammation, which will put pressure on the body, promote the continuous secretion of cortisol, reduce immunity, lead to aggravated inflammation, increased stress, and fall into a vicious cycle.
- Exercise more (train)

### 3 foods to exercise immune cells (nourishment)

1. 3 essential amino acids required for neutrophils
Intake enough protein from food (fish, meat, eggs) every day.

2. Vitamin D
Intake from fungus, mushrooms, fish, eggs, salmon roe, and sun exposure to natural ultraviolet rays.

3. Desserts with resistant starch to improve immunity
Eat bananas, especially green bananas.

### Habits to improve immunity

1. Stay away from people and things that bring negative emotions
Negative information will cause stress and anxiety, and negative emotions will spread to others and affect your life.

2. Singing
Singing your favorite songs will reduce cortisol in saliva and improve immunity.

3. Be grateful
Thanking things in daily life will make the brain secrete happiness hormones, such as serotonin. Serotonin improves cortisol levels, which boosts immunity. People who are grateful have lower levels of interleukin-6, which causes chronic inflammation.

### Tips to increase happiness

1. Watch cute cats and dogs

2. Gentle massage

3. Listen to warm music (528HZ), watch warm and touching movies that heal the soul

4. Touch soft objects (pillows, blankets, plush toys)

5. Alternate warm and cold baths, 40 degrees warm water, 25 degrees cold water (the water temperature should not be lower than 25 degrees, because cold water below 25 degrees will increase body stress and increase cortisol secretion

### Common points of happy people

1. Do not deny yourself
Only by accepting yourself and affirming your life can you be calm and bring happiness to others.
Reflection and adjusting your thoughts and behaviors are beneficial to the future, but blindly denying yourself and your life is equivalent to depriving yourself of your future.
Continuous self-denial will reduce self-esteem and self-efficacy. It will make you lose confidence and increase anxiety about the future.

2. Take a new step at any time

3. Express your heartfelt love to your family and important people

4. Thank you for the once-in-a-lifetime encounter

5. Enjoy every moment of the present
6. The courage and awareness to entrust important initiatives to others
