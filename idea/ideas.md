## Reversible and Irreversible Decisions

Making decisions, even in areas you know relatively well, usually involves an element of uncertainty. Sometimes decisions can be made quickly, and uncertainty is acceptable or desirable. Other times, decisions are made slowly and deliberately to remove as much uncertainty as possible.

Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon.com, considers decisions like doors. He asks himself if the decision is a one-way door or a two-way door. What’s the difference?

Once you walk through a one-way door, you can’t come back. It’s irreversible. With a two-way door, on the other hand, you can walk through, look around, and easily come back to where you started.

In a shareholder letter, Bezos wrote[1]:

>Some decisions are consequential and irreversible or nearly irreversible – one-way doors – and these decisions must be made methodically, carefully, slowly, with great deliberation and consultation. If you walk through and don’t like what you see on the other side, you can’t get back to where you were before. We can call these Type 1 decisions. But most decisions aren’t like that – they are changeable, reversible – they’re two-way doors. If you’ve made a suboptimal Type 2 decision, you don’t have to live with the consequences for that long. You can reopen the door and go back through. Type 2 decisions can and should be made quickly by high judgment individuals or small groups.

>As organizations get larger, there seems to be a tendency to use the heavy-weight Type 1 decision-making process on most decisions, including many Type 2 decisions. The end result of this is slowness, unthoughtful risk aversion, failure to experiment sufficiently, and consequently diminished invention. We’ll have to figure out how to fight that tendency.


Decisions fall somewhere on the continuum from reversible to irreversible. You can tell where a decision lies on this spectrum by asking how much it would cost to undo. The higher the cost to undo, the more irreversible it is. The lower the cost, the more reversible it is.

**When decisions are reversible, make them fast.** Your biggest risk is dragging your feet and not making a decision. The cost to acquire additional information isn’t worth the effort.

**When decisions are irreversible, slow them down.** The biggest risk is making the wrong decision. The cost to get the information we need to reduce uncertainty is worth the time and effort.

### Avoiding Analysis Paralysis

Make reversible decisions as soon as possible. Make irreversible decisions as late as possible.

Bezos considers 70% certainty as the cut-off point where it is appropriate to make a decision. That means acting once we have 70% of the required information, instead of waiting longer. Making a decision at 70% certainty and then quickly course-correcting is much more effective than waiting for 90% certainty.

In conclusion, the biggest risk to irreversible decisions is deciding before you need to. The biggest risk to reversible ones is waiting until the last minute.

## Yield and Risk

When you invest on a project, the yield and risk comes simultaneously. The safety of principal is more important the interest. Long-term yield is more valuable than short-term yield. The ability to create continuous yield in the future is more important than the present interest. You should learn to judge and analyse the strategy to make a wise investment.

## Procrastination and Depression

Procrastination probably comes from great pressure instead of laziness. When you find that difficulties are great than your ability after trying many times, you are likely to feel upset and refuse to try it again. Therefore, you procastinate solving problems and obtain a sense of weakness. If you suffer from this kind of state for quite a long time, you may get depression. In order to solve this issue, you need to find out the reason behind it, the real problem under the issue. Then simplify and divide the issue into several small pieces. According to the tiny problem and your resources, consider effective strategy to deal with it. Make several conservative, neutral and radical plans and evaluate their yields, costs and risks. Next, choose the proper plan for yourself and specify your plan. Finally, execute the plan and adjust it from the feedback during the process.
