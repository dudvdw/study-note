## Do you agree that many people nowadays are under pressure to work longer hours and take less holiday?
Totally. It seems that over work is the norm in most of the big cities around the world. Some may do it voluntarily, but I guess most people feel compelled（被迫的） to do so because of the fierce competition - they are constantly worried about being replaced if they don't work hard enough. Technology is not doing us any good(对某人有好处) either because now we are expected to respond to emails and messages at all hours, even when we're on holiday, which means the line between work life and personal life is increasingly blurred(模糊的), putting us in a position where we find it impossible to take time off(休息).

## What is the impact on society of people having a poor work-life balance?
Well obviously people's health will suffer if they are constantly overloaded. Not only will fatigue lead to reduced productivity at work, but working late every night will also put a strain on people's relationships with their family and friends, which will certainly have seriously negative impact on their social life. For example, children of an overworked couple are usually at risk of underachieving(表现不佳) at school.
