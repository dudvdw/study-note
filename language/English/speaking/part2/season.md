Describe your favourite season in your country.
You should say:
When that season is
What the weather is like at that time of year
How that season is different from other seasons
And why it it your favourite season

My favourite season in my country is spring. Spring in China would last around 3 mounths between March and May, but when I say that I like the spring, I'm really thinking about the beginning month of it.

When spring comes each year, ice in the lake becomes melting, as the temperature increasing gradually. Everywhere is full of vitality. You can see that grass and trees start sprouting and animals like birds and squirrels are more animated/alive than before. More and more people start to do exercises on the street, in the park or some squares, like walking, jogging, swimming outdoor, playing Taiji and so on.

If you have seen the countdown to the opening ceremony of the Beijing Winter Olympics, you may know that the traditional Chinese lunar calendar divides the year into 24 solar terms, summarizing the exact time of the four seasons in a year and the laws of natural phenomena, such as spring birth, summer growth, autumn harvest, winter storage, as well as changes in sunlight, rainfall, and temperature. The beginning of spring is the first of the 24 solar terms, reflecting the alternation of the winter and spring seasons. It also marks the end of the winter when all things are closed and stored, and the beginning of a spring when everything is warm and windy, and everything grows.

The reason I've chosen spring as my favourite season is because I like the recovery and growth scene in this season. In my opinion, summer is too scorching(灼热的) hot, autume is too bleak and winter is too cold and boring. Different from other seasons, spring is just perfect and everything becomes better. You can see vitality and hope from it. Besides, I like to capture the beautiful scenery with my camera in the season. For example, the Summer Palace, Botanical Garden, Temple of Heaven, and some parks in Beijing are all excellent places for taking photographs in spring.
