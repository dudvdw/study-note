I'd like to talk about Chinese Dumplings, which are the most traditional and popular meal in some important festivals, like Spring Festival and Winter Solstice(冬至).

On Spring Festival, all of the family members will go back home and prepare a wonderful dinner/banquet for New Year's Eve together. Dumplings are the most indispensable/essential/irreplaceable meal for the important festival. They look like ingots(元宝), half-moon-shaped, named from a currency used in Song Dynasty. Therefore, eating dumplings at the Spring Festival is said to bring good fortune financially.

Dumplings have all sorts of stuffings, ranging from various meat to diverse vegetables, even mushroom. Moreover, distinct stuffings have different symbolic meanings. For example, celery stuffing(芹菜) represents industriousness and wealth, because celery sounds like 'industrious wealth' in mandarin. Fish stuffing means surplus wealth, since 'fish' sounds the same as 'surplus'. So eating fish dumplings means wishing you have a lot of remaining money. Sometimes we will put some coins or candies in some dumplings as making them. If you eat one dumpling with a coin, it means you will make a lot of money in the new year. If you eat one containing a candy, it denotes your life will be happy and sweet in the next year.

It is very interesting to make dumplings with my family members. After setting off firecrackers and fireworks, all the family members will sit around one big round table, having a wonderful dinner and watching TV programmes together.

I'd like to talk about Spring Festival, which is the most traditional and important festival in China. On Spring Festival, all of the family members will go back home to celebrate the festival and prepare a wonderful dinner/banquet for New Year's Eve together. Among the various dishes served on this auspicious night,  dumplings hold a special place.

Dumplings named from an ancient Chinese currency. They are not only delicious but also carry symbolic meanings. Dumplings have all sorts of fillings, ranging from various meat to diverse vegetables, even mushroom. Each filling has its own significance and meaning. For instance, dumplings filled with celery(芹菜) represents diligence and wealth, while those filled with fish signify surplus wealth. 

What makes the process of making dumplings even more enjoyable is the involvement of the entire family. We gather in the kitchen, each with a specific task. Sometimes we will put some coins or candies in dumplings as making them. If you eat one dumpling with a coin, it means you will make a lot of money in the new year. If you eat one containing a candy, it denotes your life will be happy and sweet in the next year.

After setting off firecrackers and fireworks, all of the family members will sit around one big round table, having a wonderful dinner and watching TV programs together. 

I truly enjoy the Spring Festival celebration because it brings my loved ones together and allows us to escape from our busy lives. The atmosphere is filled with warmth, laughter, and a sense of tradition that has been passed down through generations.
