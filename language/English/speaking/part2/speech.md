## Describe a time when you had to talk to a group of people.

You should say:

When it happened

Who you talked to

Why you gave this talk

And explain why you had to give this talk

One memorable time when I had to talk to a group of people was during a conference when I won "the excellent employee of the year" award in my company. At the end of each year, the company directors give the award to some staffs who has made an outstanding contribution to the business in the past year.

I first heard about this prize during my six-month probationary(试用的) period just after I got my job. It was the end of the year and some of my colleagues discussed who might be awarded the prize. I was interested about it and asked them more about the prize.

At the summary conference last year, I received the award and had to give a small speech as usual. I was so excited and exhilarated at that moment. I expressed my pleasure and gratitude/appreciation to my colleagues who worked with me and helped me in that year.

I feel proud of myself that I won "the excellent employee of the year" award, because it denotes/means that my work makes contribution to our company and gets fully affirmed by my director and colleagues. It also give me a great sense of personal achievement.
