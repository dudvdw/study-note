The person I know who absolutely loves growing plants is my mother. She has a natural talent for gardening and finds immense joy in cultivating various types of plants, including flowers and vegetables. Her passion for this hobby is evident in the way she takes care of her plants with love and dedication.

In our small garden, my mom creates a beautiful display of flowers. She carefully selects different kinds, paying attention to their colors and scents. The garden becomes a vibrant and colorful oasis, full of Chinese roses, daisies, jasmines, and many other types of blossoms. Additionally, she maximizes space by planting flowers in pots, decorating our ledges（窗台） and rooms with a variety of blooming colors.

But she doesn’t stop there. My mother’s love for growing plants also extends to practicality. In our yard, she has a special area where she grows various vegetables, like lettuce, tomatoes, carrots, pepper, and beans. It’s amazing to see how tiny seeds turn into lush plants that provide us with delicious, homegrown produce. She takes pride in using these vegetables in our meals, knowing that they were nurtured through her own efforts.

The reason why my mom enjoys this activity is simple. Firstly, she finds comfort and relaxation in being surrounded by nature. Gardening allows her to unwind/relax and escape the stresses of everyday life. It serves as a form of therapy, bringing her a sense of peace and contentment.

Furthermore, my mother derives great pleasure from witnessing the growth and blooming of her plants. Seeing the results of her labor, both literally and figuratively, brings a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction. There is a deep joy in knowing that she is nurturing life and adding beauty to our surroundings.
