I'm going to talk about cooking, which is a practical skill that I use almost everyday.

I learnt to cook when I was a middle school student. Because my parents sometimes were very busy for work. I had to cook meal for myself. Actually, I was not good at it and merely cook some simple meals at that time. When I started to work, I had a lot of spare time at weekends. I began to learn cooking from some applications which taught you to cook a dish step by step, with detailed instructions, images, even videos.

I like cooking, and every procedure is very interesting, like choosing ingredients in the market, cooking following the recipe in my kitchen and the most important part, enjoying it on the table. I often go to a street market near my home to buy some ingredients for cooking. It contains dozens of shops, selling all kinds of things for cooking, vegetables, meat, fruit, seafood, condiment(调味品) and so on. When you don't know which kind of ingredient you should buy, the shop owner can give you some advice/proposals according to your specific demand.

One of my favourite dishes is fish, because it is delicious and won't cost much time for cooking. After you choose a live fish at the market, the shop owner will slaughter/kill the fish and process it according to your demand. I always fry the fish using slow fire before cooking, that will make the outer layer crisp（酥脆的）. Then I will stir-fry/cook the onion, chilli（红辣椒）, garlic（蒜） and Star Anise（八角）, adding sauce, a bowl of water and a spoon of salt. Finally, put the fried fish and vegetables in the pot. After about 15 minutes, the delicious fish is ready to come out of the pot.

I think cooking is not only interesting but also very enjoyable. You can gain a sense of achievement from it when you complete a dish. And the best part is that you will get a reward after cooking, enjoying the dish.
