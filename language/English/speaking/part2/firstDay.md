The first day I remember at university holds a special place in my heart. It marked a significant turning point in my life as I left the comfort of my hometown to pursue higher education in a new city. I can still recall the details vividly.

On that day, my uncle and aunt kindly accompanied me on the journey to the university. Their presence provided a sense of comfort and support during this transitional phase. As we arrived on campus, a wave of excitement and nervousness washed over me.

To help us navigate the enrollment process, student mentors were assigned to each incoming student. The student mentor received me introduced himself warmly, offering guidance and answering any questions. With his assistance, the enrollment registration proceeded smoothly.

After completing the registration, it was time to settle into my dormitory. As I entered the building, a mix of anticipation and curiosity filled me. Meeting my roommates for the first time was a moment full of both excitement and apprehension. Our introductions quickly turned into ice-breaking conversations, and we discovered shared interests and aspirations.

One aspect that stood out(脱颖而出) on that first day was the presence of an airport near the campus. The noise of planes taking off and landing could be heard. This unexpected noise posed a challenge, as it made falling asleep a bit harder. However, it wasn't long before I gradually adapted to the noise from the airport.

The reason why that day leaves a deep impression in my memory is because it was the first time I went away from my hometown for an extended period(长期). It signified stepping outside my comfort zone and embracing new experiences. The vibrant campus life and meeting new people left a profound impression on me. It was the beginning of a transformative journey, fostering personal growth and lifelong friendships.
