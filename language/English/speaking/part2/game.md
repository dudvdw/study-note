During my childhood, one of the happiest experiences I had was playing marbles with my friends. After completing my homework, it was a common sight to see us gathering together to engage in this popular game.

Playing marbles brought me a lot of fun. My favorite was a particular game format that allowed players to win a significant number of marbles if they excelled at it. To begin, we would draw a rectangular shape on the ground, approximately 30 centimeters long and 20 centimeters wide. Then, each participant would contribute some marbles as the bet, placing them inside the rectangular boundary. The objective was to use a marble to knock the marbles within the rectangle out of it, with each successful hit resulting in a win. However, if we failed to achieve this, we would lose our marble and have to place it inside the rectangular area.

As I stood behind the line, ready to launch my marble towards the target, a mixture of excitement and nerves enclosed/enveloped me. Despite a bit of anxiety, I felt a strong sense of confidence in my skills. Even before releasing my marble, I could usually predict the outcome of this hit. We referred to this as “hand feeling,” a vital factor for the game. Whenever luck was on my side and I won numerous marbles, it felt like I had conquered the world. However, there were also occasions when I misjudged my hand feeling, resulting in disappointing losses of my beloved marbles.
