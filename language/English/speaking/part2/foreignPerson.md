## Describe a foreign person that you would like to meet.
You should say:
Who the person is?
How you first learned about him or her?
Why the person is famous?
And explain why you would like to meet this person?

I'm going to describe a famous businessman and investor called Elon Musk. He is the founder and chief engineer of SpaceX, CEO of Tesla and Twitter and co-founder of several technical companies. 

I first learned about him on internet when I was an university student. I saw a news about Falcon 9 rocket produced by SpaceX which has been successfully recovered at sea for the first time. It had great significance for promoting the development of the aerospace industry. From then on, I paid attention on news about him. One day, I found he starred with Howard in one episode of 'The Big Bang Theory', a popular American TV show. That was very interesting for a businessman who always show a serious elite image. 

Elon Musk is famous for his extraordinary/fabulous wealth and he has been the wealthiest human on the planet three times. People are always surprised by his investment vision and talent which bring him huge fortune. But beyond that, I suppose he is considering about the future of human, not merely working for money. 

There is no doubt that energy issue determines how long we can continue living on the planet. The success of Tesla points out a development direction of our vehicles in the future and also offer a feasible solution to deal with the energy and environmental problems. In another field, aerospace, SpaceX plan enables the rocket to be reused, dramatically cutting the cost of space flight. It may become a starting point for human to migrate to another planet. 

I believe that is the reason why I'm so interested in him.
