## Describe a old building.
You should say:
Where it is?
What it is used for?
And explain why you like/dislike it?

I'm going to describe a famous building in Beijing: the Imperial Palace (the Forbbiden City). It's not a single building, but an ancient architectural complex which was build by Yongle emperor of the Ming dynasty. It was named as the Forbbiden City because access to the area was barred(阻挡，禁止) to most of the subjects（臣民） of the realm（王国）. Even government functionaries(官员) and the imperial family were permitted only limited access.

There are four city gates around the Forbidden City, Wu Gate at the south, Shenwu Gate at the north, Donghua Gate at the east, Xihua Gate at the west. Walking through the Wu Gate, there is a river called Golden Water River running in a large courtyard. The river is crossed by five parallel white marble bridges, which lead to the Gate of Supreme Harmony(Taihemen). There are two large bronze lions standing in front of the Gate of Supreme Harmony, bringing you a sense of solemn and dignified.

North of the Gate of Supreme Harmony lies the Outer Court, heart of the Forbidden City. There are three main administration halls standing in the Outer Court, the largest single building is the Hall of Supreme Harmony, in which the throne（宝座，王位） of the emperor stands. Farther north lies the Inner Court, which contains the three halls that composed the imperial living area/quarters(住处，四分之一). At the northernmost limit of the Forbidden City is the Imperial Garden, which was designed as a place of relaxation for the emperor, with all kinds of trees, flower beds, sculptures and fish ponds.

After the Revolution of 1911, the Forbidden City was transformed into the Palace Museum, used for the purpose of cultural education. And the precious cultural relics/treasures become the common wealth of the entire nation instead of only serving for the emperor to enjoy.
