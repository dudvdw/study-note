I want to talk about the Compulsory Education Law in our country which went into effect from July 1st, 1986. The Compulsory Education Law stipulates（规定） that all school-age children and adolescents enjoy the equal right to receive a nine-year compulsory education according to the law, regardless of gender, ethnicity(民族), race, religious blief and so on. The State establishes a mechanism for ensuring the funding of compulsory education to guarantee the implementation of the compulsory education system, so children receiving compulsory education don't need to pay tuition fees.

The Compulsory Education Law has played an important role in improving the quality of education and promoting the development of compulsory education. Each school-age children can learn the culture and knowledge at school, which is helpful for them to find a good job in the future. Without cultural knowledge, people can hardly adapt to the rapid developing society. For example, my aunt is illiterate, it is very difficult for her to find a place quickly in a modern city with text signs everywhere.

In my opinion, the Compulsory Education Law not only benefit all school-age children in our country, but also contribute to the society and national economy. The compulsory education system cultivates a large number of talents who are the backbone of constructing the society in the future. A better quality of education denotes a higher developing speed, so it is very important to ensure the educational quality according to the Compulsory Education Law.
