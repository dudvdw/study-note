I'd like to talk about the conversation I had with some foreigners for the first time which was happened on a train. I remember it took place in a winter of 2009 when I was a senior high school student.
I took train to see/call on my grandma with my mum.

several foreigners got on the train halfway through the journey
a very strong and tall man
two women
two children with golden hair
