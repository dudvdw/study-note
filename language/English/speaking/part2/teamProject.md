I'd like to talk about a team project I accomplished with my colleagues when I was working in a software company. 

It was the first big project I attended during my six-month probationary(试用的) period just after I got my first job. I didn't have any experience of large corporate project before, so I felt stressed at the beginning. After a review meeting of the requirements, I knew that we were going to build a new system used for creating and editing knowledge about our company. These knowledge will display both on PC terminal and mobile terminal, like laptops, smartphones and tablets.

There were 5 software engineers engaging in this project, but I was the only novice in the team. Our director assigned different tasks to each of us according to the product requirement document. I was in charge of the editing knowledge part which would be accomplished by a rich text editor. Users can enter text and edit its fontsize, color and so on. They can also insert and edit other forms of text, such as table, picture, audio and video. 

I didn't have developing experience on rich text editor, so I did some research and found an open source editor which could meet our demands. The codes of the open source editor was over 30,000 lines which astonished me at first. In order to delete some unnecessary functions and add a few required functions, I had to read the long and complex codes to understand how the editor deal with the text. After immersing in these codes for about two days, I tried to embed the editor into our new system. 

During the process of developing the rich text editor, I came across many problems. For example, the editor should be equipped with a draft function to store the text which user was editing but hadn't finished yet. You can not save these data on your server because the user may edit several texts at the same time and the server can not distinguish these texts and return the right version to user when he needed. For solving this problem, I found a lot of materials on the Internet. Eventually, I determined to save the drafts on user's device by applying a feature of browser and it worked.

I remember I felt so tired and full of stress in the project because we had to complete it before the deadline. However, I have accumulated some practical experience and developed expertise in it. Besides, I won "the excellent employee of the year" award at the end of that year, and it gave me a great sense of personal achievement.
