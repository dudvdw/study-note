## Describe a library that you visited
You should say:
Where the library was
What facilities it had
Why you went there
And explain whether you found the library useful or not.

Today I'd like to talk about the library I used to go to when I was in university several years ago. The library was a landmark in the middle of the campus, storing over one million books, magazines and newspapers as it annouced. It had five floors, including many reading rooms and self-study rooms. 

I have enjoyed reading since I was a child. No matter where I went, I would like to go to the local book stores. I felt very delighted and satisfied when I saw rows of bookshelves, arranging neatly with a wide range of books. So I'd like to do some reading with my classmates in the library when we had spare time, or borrowed several books from there. I still remember the first book I read there was a biography about a famous Chinese painter XuBeihong, written by his wife, LiaoJingwen. And I made an excel sheet to record my reading experience, containing the book name, its category and theme and reading time. I had probably read over 110 books throughout my school years, and some of them were tomes(巨著) about history and natural science.

I think library is quite useful for me because I could nearly find all the necessary materials I needed in my major. In addtion, I have acquired all sorts of knowledge besides my major, literature, art, physics, economy and so on. That broadened my horizon and enriched my knowledge.

All in all, the library played an important role in my campus life and I wish I could visit it again some time in the future.
