I want to talk about Bruce Lee, a famous actor who have passed away for 50 years.
I firstly saw him in a movie named The Way of The Dragon, when I was a student in middle school.

This film narrates a story that a young man named Tang Long coming from rural Hong Kong go to Rome alone to assist a restaurant manager. This restaurant is often threatened by a commercial group, forcing them to sell their land and often sending gangsters to cause trouble, resulting in deteriorating restaurant business. When Tang Long arrives in Rome, he is not accustomed to local customs. The staff and the manager at the restaurant dislike him at first. One night, the gangsters come to cause trouble again, and a waiter is knocked unconscious. Tang Long angrily take action and knock down the gangsters. Everyone are impressed by his Chinese Kongfu.

I admire Bruce Lee so much because he was not only a successful actor, but also a philosopher and martial artist. He created a new modern martial arts system, Jeet Kune Do, based on his understanding of the martial arts and philosophy. I have read a related book named Tao of Jeet Kune Do written by Bruce Lee. Unfortunately, he passed away all of a sudden in 1973. Although he was only 32 years old when he died, he had performed several excellent and high-quality films and left a big fortune on martial arts.
