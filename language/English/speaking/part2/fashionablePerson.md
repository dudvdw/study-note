## Describe a person who is fashionable.
You should say:
Who he/she is
What he/she does
What kind of clothes he/she wears
And explain why you think this person is fashionable

I want to talk about an actor named Huge who has performed a lot of films and TV drama/play. He is one of my favourite Chinese actor.

In a famous ceremony of Chinese Movie Festival, he was wearing a black suit, a white dress shirt with neckties, a pair of leather shoes. He looked handsome and fashionable at this occasion. At first, I supposed that the fashionable impression came from his luxury clothes. When I learned much about him, I found I was wrong.

Huge has endorsed many brands, such as Armani, Chanel, Sony and some car brands. He always wears different type of clothes in these advertisement campaigns. Sometimes, he wear a simple overcoat with a pure color T-shirt inside; somtimes, he dresses in a black jacket with a trendy haircut. It seems that no matter what he wears, he looks fashionable. 

Compared with other actors, I find the reason why he looks fashionable is that he can choose a suitable cloth and haircut according to different situation. Besides, he owns an attractive and charming temperament/personality which makes him more fashionable. In addition, he looks confident in front of the camera. I believe these factors contribute to his fashionable image.
