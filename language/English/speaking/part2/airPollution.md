When I was a middle school student, in my hometown, I visited a place where the air was heavily polluted. Near a waste incineration plant, I witnessed/saw an alarming sight - piles of waste, mainly consisting of plastic waste, they were left untreated and accumulating. This created a detrimental impact on the environment and air quality.

One striking feature of this site was the tall chimney associated with the waste incineration plant. It stood as a vivid reminder(赤裸裸的提醒) of the combustion/burning process happening within. Unfortunately, instead of being treated effectively, the burning of the waste produced a large cloud of dense smog hanging(悬挂) in the air. The consequences of this pollution were evident. The accumulated waste became an eyesore(不顺眼的东西) to the residents nearby and the polluted air made it difficult to breathe freely, especially in winter. 

However, I am pleased to say that since then, positive changes have taken place. The chimney that once emitted noxious gases has been demolished, a sign of progress towards cleaner and healthier air. Efforts have also been made to improve waste management practices and reduce plastic waste.

Reflecting on that place, I felt a mix of sadness and determination. Observing such environmental degradation made me realize the urgent need for sustainable practices and conscious efforts to protect our planet. It motivated me to take action in my own life, adopting eco-friendly habits and advocating for environmental awareness.
