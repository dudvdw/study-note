## Describe a person that you admire.
You should say:
Who the person is?
What he/she is like?
And explain why you admire him or her?

I'd like to talk about a famous politician Deng Xiaoping, who is an outstanding leader with high prestige in China. My first impression of him comes from history book which says he is the chief designer of China's reform and opening-up and the founder of the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics. The photo shows he is not tall but smart with a soft/amiable smile on his face.

Actually, I don't know much about him until I have read several biographies about him. His life is full of legends, successively studying in France and Russia, becoming a leader in Communist Party, leading a series of uprisings/revolts, organizing and commanding many battles before building a new China in 1949. 

He made a lot of contributions to the country after 1949. For example, he created a theory of socialism with Chinese characteristics which laid the foundation for development of China after 1978. In addition, he creatively proposed the concept of "one China, two system" based on reality, promoting the development of peace and stability in the world. 

I have read Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping which are a series of books containing his articles. You can learn about the history of China and methodology in it. I think Deng is one of the most important and excellent leaders in recent history of China. Without him and his Deng Xiaoping Theory, China can not become the second largest economy in the world and we can not live a rich life today.
