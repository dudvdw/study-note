I'm going to talk about an experience which happend in my National Day holiday. This was about ten years ago when I was an undergraduate at university, but that experience is still fresh in my mind.

Before the National Day holiday, I made a specific plan about how to spend my holiday. In my schedule, I would meet a friend in Shanghai, then we would take a trip to Huangshan, a famous mountain which is located at Anhui Province. After the three day's trip, we would go to Nanjing, having a brief stay there, then we went back to our schools separately.

However, oneday, about 2 weeks before the National Day holiday, one of my high school classmates told me she and another classmate would travel to Tianjin where I was studying, and asked me if I could take her around the city as a guide. Since I hadn't book the tickets for my trip, I agreed her request.

Then I prepared for my trip, buying tickets and some necessities for mountain-climbing, booking a hotel room, and borrowing a tent, a professional camera from my classmates respectively. Since my whole National Day holiday would be on the road, I had to finish all my homework before the holiday. The pressure of such a close deadline actually forced me to manage the task in a really efficient way.

On the first day of the holiday, I met my high school classmates, taking them to some famous scenic spots in the city, such as Ancient Culture Street, Sky Tower, Italian style historic district, Memorial Hall and so on.
I treated them with Goubuli stuffed bun, a famous snack of Tianjin. The next morning, another classmate came to us with her brother from Beijing, when she heard of we were together. Then we went to Tianjin Aquatic Park, wandering in the park, rowing on a lake, and taking some photos.In that evening, I went to the railway station in a hurry, taking a train to Shanghai.

In the morning of the third day, I arrived at Shanghai, my friend was waiting for me at the train station. Then we met another friend at a Japanese restaurant, and we talked a lot about our recent situations. After lunch, we took a train from Shanghai to Huangshan.

When we arrived at the bottom of the mountain on the fourth day morning, we took a tour bus to the start point of the mountain-climbing. The mountain path was so narrow and rugged(崎岖的) that it can merely accomodate two buses abreast(并列). On one side of the path was mountain covered with green bamboos, on the other side was cliff. Although the bus driver manipulated the steering wheel smoothly, we felt so scared and exlaimed, just as riding a roller coaster, especially encountering another oncoming bus at a curve(拐弯处).

We got off the bus at Ciguang Pavilion, starting climbing the mountain. The scenery along the way was very beautiful and magnificent. We met the famous visitor-greeting pine, climbed to the top of Lotus Flower Peak which is the highest one among all peaks in Huangshan, and we saw the gorgeous sunset there. In the evening of the fourth day, we slept in our tent at the Bright Summit.

Before the dawn of the fifth day, we got up early preparing to see the sunrise at the Bright summit. It was still in the dark when we got out of our tent. However, many travellers had already occupied an excellent/wonderful oberservation/vantage(优势) point. The sky was gradually getting light and blue, we could see the sea of clouds, which was silent and grand, full of rolling white waves. After a while, the  sky along the horizon was turning to pink, mixed with orange-red, and we could glimpse a little part of the sun concealing in the clouds. Then the sky was completely turning to orange-red, flashing golden light, as the sun coming out of the clouds slowly. Finally, the sun jumped out of the horizon, its golden light spread all over the sea of clouds. 

After visiting the Xihai Grand Canyon, we felt so tired that we had to take the funicular(a type of railway which goes up a very steep mountain) to the bottom of the mountain. Then we visited Hongcun, a small but beautiful village near Huangshan. 

On the last day, we went to Nanjing, visiting the Zhongshan Mausoleum, which is the mausoleum of Sun Yat-sen, the great pioneer of the democratic revolution in modern China. After that, we finished our trip and went back to our schools respectively.
