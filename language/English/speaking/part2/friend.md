## Describe your best friend.
You should say:
Who the person is?
How you know each other?
And explain why he/she is your best friend?

I met my best friend at senior high school, we sat next to each other in the same class for over two years. He is very smart and interesting, we always discussed problems and played together. We have been friends ever since and we've known each other for over 10 years now.

After graduated from university, I became an engineer in a software company in Beijing, and he became a doctor in a hospital at Shanghai. Due to busy work, we haven't seen each other for a long time, but we always send messages. When we were university students, sometimes we played together on holiday. I remember we have gone to Huangshan together in one National Day holiday. Huangshan is a famous mountain which is located at Anhui Province. 

I remember when we arrived at the bottom of the mountain in the morning, we took a tour bus to the start point of the mountain-climbing. The mountain path was so narrow and rugged(崎岖的) that it can merely accomodate two buses abreast(并列). On one side of the path was mountain covered with green bamboos, on the other side was cliff. Although the bus driver manipulated the steering wheel smoothly, we felt so scared and exlaimed, just as riding a roller coaster, especially encountering another oncoming bus at a curve(拐弯处).

We got off the bus at Ciguang Pavilion, starting climbing the mountain. The scenery along the way was very beautiful and magnificent. We met the famous visitor-greeting pine, climbed to the top of Lotus Flower Peak which is the highest one among all peaks in Huangshan, and we saw the gorgeous sunset there. In the evening, we slept in our tent at the Bright Summit. It was a memorable experience.

About five years ago, my friend invited me to be the best man(伴郎) in his wedding ceremony. I was so excited that I can undergo the most important day with him. The ceremony was perfect, and we all had a fatastic time at the ceremony.
