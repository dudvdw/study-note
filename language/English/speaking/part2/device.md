## Describe a time when you started using a new technological device
You should say:
what device you started using
why you started using this device
How easy or difficult it was to use
And explain how helpful this device was to you.

I'm not really obsessed with electronics so I'm not always upgrading my phone to the latest model or trying out new gadgets. But anyway I think I can talk about the time when I first switched from PC to Mac several years ago.

First, I think I'll tell you about why I made this decision. Well, actually I've been using PC for many years. Although my old laptop ran a bit slowly, it still can meet my requirements. After I changed the mechinical hard drive to a new solid state drive(SSD), it ran fast again. When I started working in my company, one colleague told me that Macbook will increase working efficiency because of its great design. Then I bought my first Macbook from Apple online store.

When I began to use the new laptop, I didn't adapt to its system which was much/vastly different from Windows. I can't leave my mouse when I was using PC before. However, after I learnt more about Mac operating system, I found it became more and more convenient to me. For example, I can press combined shortcut keys to execute associated command or input commands in its terminal. Besides, the touch pad was an excellent substitute for mouse, and you didn't need to charge it.

I find Mac is very helpful because I can launch and switch applications quickly and the terminal is so powerful. When I write and debug programme, I always input commands instead of using a mouse to operate. Besides, Mac has a high-resolution screen which is comfortable to your eyes. And it achieve long battery life which means you can use it for a long time without charging. I think it is not just cost-effective but increase my productivity as my colleague said.

One problem I encountered while shopping online was when I purchased a new MacBook Pro from the official Apple website. Actually I've been using PC for many years. Although my old laptop ran a bit slowly, it  can still meet my requirements. When I started working in my company, I heard of that Macbook will increase working efficiency because of its excellent design. Then I bought my first Macbook from Apple online store. 

Initially, I didn't adapt to its operating system which was much/vastly different from Windows and I felt unsure about how to navigate the operating system and optimize the laptop’s performance, so I decided to seek assistance/help from the after-sales service personnel. 

After contacting the after-sales service team, I explained my concerns and the specific challenges I was facing. The representative I interacted with was patient, knowledgeable, and provided clear instructions tailored to my needs. He answered my questions, and shared tips on how to make the most of my MacBook Pro.

I no longer felt anxious and frustrated by the complexities of the laptop’s features and functions. Instead, I gained confidence and gradually became more proficient in using the MacBook Pro for my work tasks. The after-sales service personnel left a positive impression on me. Their professionalism and attitude to customer were admirable. It made me feel valued as a customer and reinforced my trust in the brand. I felt grateful for their assistance and optimistic about my future interactions with the product.
