## a significant programme/study/science experiment

I'm going to talk about one of my favourite educational TV programmes called The Light of Technology. In this programme, the audience in front of the TV can compete with the guests in the studio to guess some small scientific questions. The host will use specific experiments to solve these small questions that are not far from us and cannot be guessed.

I first saw The Light of Technology on television when I was 13 years old in secondary school. I remember it was shown every Saturday evening, and I was always waiting for it in front of the television after super. Sometimes, my father and my mother will watch this programme with me.

I found this TV programme by accident, when I watched TV one day. I was soon attracted/fascinated by this educational programme which contained a series of interesting experiments. From then on, I kept watching the programme on every Saturday evening.

What I liked most about The light of Technology was its attractive programme style. It felt like that you were in the studio along with the guests and the host, thinking about the question, watching the experiment and listening to the host's explanation carefully. I still remember an interesting question: What happens when a green laser beam is fired at three balloons, red, green, and white? The answer is that the red balloon bursts. The reason is that the white and the green balloon can reflect green light, but the red one can not. Meantime, the red balloon can not transfer heat out quickly, eventually it bursts. In addtion, the host will talk about the application of this technology in our daily life. It's really an excellent educational TV programme to school-age children.
