## Describe an occasion when you lost your way.

You should say:

Where you were

What happened

How you felt about it

And explain how you found your way


I want to share an experience where I lost my way and had to find my own path again. It happened a few weeks ago when I was on my way to work and encountered heavy rain along the journey. Although having brought an unbrella, I ended up getting drenched/wetted, including the backpack. When I arrived at the company, I discovered that my computer couldn't be charged properly. Determined to fix this issue, I promptly made an appointment for maintenance through apple's official website.

The location of the after-sales service store was unfamiliar to me, so I relied on a map application on my phone for guidance. The navigation led me to the central business district (CBD), where numerous tall buildings stood densely. However, as I followed the suggested route, my position on the map changed abruptly. I realized that the map application was misleading me, directing me to different places haphazardly/randomly. As I aimlessly walked back and forth, I grew increasingly frustrated and lost.

Desperate for assistance, I approached several passers-by, hoping someone would know the whereabouts of the after-sales service store. Unfortunately, nobody seemed familiar with its location. My frustration evolved into anger towards the map application. After spending ten minutes in utter confusion, I chanced upon a building and decided to seek help from the shopkeepers inside. Finally, I managed to locate the official maintenance store and resolved the issue with my computer.

Reflecting on this experience, I learned that navigation applications primarily rely on satellite signals to determine oneâ€™s position. When surrounded by tall buildings, these signals can become disrupted, leading to inaccurate positioning on the map and potential misguidance. It was a valuable lesson for me to be cautious when navigating areas filled with towering structures, as depending solely on technology might lead me astray/getting lost.
