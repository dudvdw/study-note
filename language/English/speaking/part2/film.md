I'm going to talk about a science fiction that I have read called Three Body. The name of this book, Three Body, is a planet four light years away from the earth. The novel narrates how humans deal with the incoming invasion of a highly-advanced alien civilization called Three-Body. The book was written by a famous Chinese science fiction writer Liu Cixin. And this novel won the Hugo Award for Best Novel several years ago. 

I'd like to read The Three Body because there are so many spectacular scenes in the book. For example, the Water-drop, an alien cosmic probe manufactured by Three Body civilization, destroyed most of humanity's space armed forces (over 2000 star class warships) in a short time. After being enslaved by the three body creatures, humans were forced to fight back and launch gravitational waves into the universe. Eventually, the coordinates of the three body parent star were exposed, and it was not long before they were destroyed. 

At the same time, a higher civilization noticed the Earth, and they launched a two-dimensional foil into the solar system to implement a dimensionality reduction strike on the solar system. In the end, the entire solar system collapsed from three-dimension into two-dimension, like an oil painting. These plots will definitely become classic scenes in the novel.

I don't think too much about the universe until I have read this novel. Although it is a science fiction, I'm convinced by the idea of this novel. I do believe that there are many civillizations in the world except the earth. Maybe some of them have a much higher level on science and technology. They probably invade our planet as a colony and enslave humans if they find the earth. 


My colleagues shared their reading on different things like Chinese ancient philosophy, history about Ming Dynasty, communication skills and so on. I remember one colleague had read a book named Nonviolent Communication, which taught people how to communicate with others in a proper way. She said her relationship with her elder sister was not good before. After she tried to communicate positively using some tips as the book said, she became much closer and more intimate with her sister.


## a film about the future

I'm going to talk about a science fiction film called Three Body. The name of this film, Three Body, is a planet (in a constellation(星座)) four light years away from the earth. The film narrates how humans deal with the incoming invasion of a highly-advanced alien civilization called Three-Body. The film is adapted by a famous Chinese science fiction with the same name. And that novel won the Hugo Award for Best Novel several years ago. 

I heard about this film by accident when I was surfing the internet one day. All of my friends who have read this novel speak very highly of it and look forward to seeing the film adapted by the excellent novel. So we purchased tickets to the movie premiere (booked movie tickets early) and decided to watch it at the first time.

However, after seeing the film in the cinema, we feel disapointed by a few factors. For example, one of the most spectacular scenes in the movie is that the Water-drop, an alien cosmic probe manufactured by Three Body civilization, destroyed most of humanity's space armed forces (over 2000 star class warships) in a short time. But actually the special effects of the movie is relatively coarse and inferior, failing to deliver the awe and spectacle it intended to portray.

Furthermore, we found that the movie struggled to capture the depth and complexity of the original novel.  It seemed as though too much information had been left out, leaving us with a sense of incompleteness. Adapting such a complex and thought-provoking story in a two-hour movie was a challenging task, and unfortunately, important elements that made the novel remarkable were not adequately portrayed.I have come to the realization that “Three Body” would have been better suited as a series rather than a single movie. 

I'd like to see The Three Body at the cinema because there are so many spectacular scenes in it. For example, the Water-drop, an alien cosmic probe manufactured by Three Body civilization, destroyed most of humanity's space armed forces (over 2000 star class warships) in a short time. After being enslaved by the three body creatures, humans were forced to fight back and launch gravitational waves into the universe. Eventually, the coordinates of the three body parent star were exposed, and it was not long before they were destroyed. At the same time, higher civilization noticed the Earth, and they launched a two-dimensional foil into the solar system to implement a dimensionality reduction strike on the solar system. In the end, the entire solar system collapsed from three-dimension into a two-dimension, like an oil painting. These plots will definitely become classic scenes in the movie.
