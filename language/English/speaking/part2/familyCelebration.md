I'm going to describe my cousin's wedding day, which took place several years ago. For my cousin, it was the biggest and most important day of her life.

I remember there were more than 200 people attending the marriage ceremony, which was held at a hotel. Of course, most members of my family were there, as well as my cousin's husband's family and a collection of the bride and groom's friends and colleagues.

As my cousin's family members, we accompanied my cousin waiting for the groom in the morning. When he came to meet the bride, we asked him to answer some questions and find the shoes of the bride which we had concealed in advance. We permited them go to the venue of marriage ceremony until he overcame all of these obstacles. As a local custom, this part is used to test the groom's perseverance and wisdom, and it also adds a lot of fun for the wedding.

When we went to the reception venue(接待会场), we found that it was nicely decorated with flowers and balloons. During the marriage ceremony, the master of the ceremony asked the parents of the groom and the bride saying something to bless the couple. When my uncle, my cousin's father, went to the center of the stage, he was apparently nervous.  He stood in front of the microphone and said nothing. I knew he was not good at talking. After about 30 second's silence, he opened his mouth, and said, "I prepared for this part last night, writing some words on a paper, but I can't find the paper now." His words brought laughter to the whole room. Then he wished the groom and the bride would love and help each other in the future, expressing his thoughts sincerely. And My cousin couldn't restrain her tears.

I enjoyed the occasion because it was great to see my cousin so happy on her big day. The ceremony was perfect, and we all had a fatastic time at the ceremony. It's rare for me to see all of my family together in one place, so that's probably what made the day so memorable for me.


## A friend's wedding, a memorable experience

I'm going to describe my best friend's wedding day, which took place several years ago. For my friend, it was the biggest and most important day of his life.

I still remember clearly that the wedding was hold on Octorber 3rd, just in the middle of National Day holiday. Before the wedding, about 2 weeks ago, my friend invited me to be the best man(伴郎) in his wedding ceremony. I was so excited that I can undergo the most important day with him. Eventually, my friend's brother and I became two candidates of the best men. And we had a complete rehearsal before the formal marriage ceremony in order to make the ceremony perfect.

On the wedding day, we accompanied my friend to meet the bride. The bridesmaids asked my friend to answer some questions about the bride's habit and their beautiful memory. Then the bridesmaids asked us to imitate a section of one magic dance video, wearing dramatic accessories. Finally, we had to find the shoes of the bride which they had concealed in advance. Eventually, after we overcame all of these obstacles, they permited the groom go to the venue of marriage ceremony with the bride. As a local custom, this part is used to test the groom's perseverance and wisdom, and it also adds a lot of fun for the wedding.

I enjoyed the occasion because it was great to see my friend so happy on his big day. The ceremony was perfect, and we all had a fatastic time at the ceremony. It's an honor for me to experience the whole wedding with my friend, so that's probably what made the day so memorable for me.
