## Describe a situation that made you angry.
You should say:
When it happend
What happended
And explain how you felt

I'm going to talk about an experience which happend on my way home for summer vocation several years ago. Because there was no through train(直达列车) from my university to my hometown, I had to transfered to another train in a station between them. I bought two tickets in advance, leaving 30 minutes to transfer.

Everything was going well when I got on the train for the first half journey. However, when the train arrived at about the middle of the first half journey, the conductor told us the train would arrive 20 minutes late due to the rainstorm. About half an hour later, it was announced that the train will delay for 40 minutes, which meant I would miss my train for the second half journey. 

I felt so sad and told my situation to the conductor. He said that the train would accelerate for the rest of the journey, and I might catch another train. Then he told me I did not need to transfer after going out of the station, I can transfer in the station by finding the corresponding platform for another train. I saw a glimmer of hope from his words.

When the train arrived at the transfering station, I rushed out as soon as the train door opend. I got to the platform for another train as the conductor said. And then it was a very funny scene. A train was gliding(滑行) smoothely/slowly out of the station in front of me. Yeah, that's just the train I should have taken(本应该乘坐的). I felt angry, powerless and a bit ridiculous at that moment.

Then I went to the ticket hall, and complained to a conductor there. The conductor apologized to me and changed my ticket for another train. However, I had to take the train in another station. Althougn I went back home eventually, I didn't want to undergo it again.
