## Describe an important conversation you had.
You should say:

Who you talked with
What you talked about
And explain why this was an important conversation to you.

I'd like to talk about the conversation I had with my mom before the college entrance examination. It was the most important exam I was going to take at that time. I was not worried much about the exam, but still feeling a bit nervous. 

I remember it was a hot/muggy night in summer just before the examination. After supper, my mum suggested to have a walk outside. Then we went outside, walking along the sidewalk(side pavement) beside the highway near my home. She seemed to recognize my anxiety and said to me no matter what the result would be, just try your best to do it and she believed I would get a good grade as usual. 

In order to relieve my anxiety, she told me a story about my grandmother which happend several decades ago when my grandmother was a junior high school student. My grandma was very smart and she skipped a grade twice at school, so she was the youngest one in her class. In the final exam, she got difficulty in one question which she had reviewed before the exam. However, her brain/mind went blank at that moment, and she can not recollect/recall even one word. Just about 10 minutes before the end of the exam, all of a sudden, the answer came to her mind. She wrote down the answer rapidly and passed the exam eventually. After my mom's words, it occured to me that my grandma who passed away one year ago said on her deathbed that it was a pity she couldn't wait for the day when I was addmitted by the university. I thought I won't fail their expectations(I would live up to their expectation).

Finally, I got a good mark in the exam and received the acceptance letter from an ideal university. My grandpa took me to sweep the tomb of my grandma and we told her the good news.
