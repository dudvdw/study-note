What it is like

And explain why you enjoy wearing it


I’d like to talk about a piece of clothing that I wear most often, which is the T-shirt. Since my middle school days, T-shirts have been a staple in my wardrobe, and I find myself wearing them almost every day, except during the freezing months when I have to layer up with thermal underwear.

In my wardrobe, I have a collection of about a dozen different T-shirts. I gravitate towards T-shirts with a concise and simple appearance, typically without any pictures or prints. I have a preference for things that have a clean and simple aesthetic. Compared to shirts, T-shirts made of cotton offer a looser and more comfortable fit, giving me a sense of freedom in my movements. I often wear T-shirts for various occasions, whether it’s going to work or engaging in physical activities like jogging, hiking, or playing badminton.

Among my collection, some T-shirts hold special meaning to me. I preserve a T-shirt which was designed by our classmates in the university. There are a graduation photo, a symbol of our class and our signatures on it. I remember that we took numerous photos wearing this T-shirt in the campus in our graduation season. This T-shirt is significant to me, and it enable me to recollect many good memories in the university. So I guess this is part of the reasons why I prefer to wear a T-shirt in daily life.
