## Describe a prize that you would like to win.
You should say:
What the prize is for
How you know about it
What you would have to do to win it
And explain why you would like to win this prize


I'm going to talk about a prize that I would like to win, which is "the excellent employee of the year" award at the company where I work. At the end of each year, the company directors give the award to some staffs who has made an outstanding contribution to the business in the last year.

I first heard about this prize during my six-month probationary(试用的) period just after I got my job four years ago. It was the end of the year and some of my colleagues discussed who might be awarded the prize. I was interested about it and asked them more about the prize.

This prize will be given for "outstanding contribution to the business". We don't have an exact definition of what it means, but we assume you make progress on some areas in your work, especially something creative. For example, what you have done increases efficiency, cuts the cost, or optimizes the experience in some aspect. 

I'd like to win "the excellent employee of the year" award, because it denotes/means that my work makes contribution to our company and gets fully affirmed by my director and colleagues. It would also give me a great sense of personal achievement.
