## Q1: Now, first, tell me something about yourselt. Tell me about where you live in your country. Is the place you live in large or small?

A1: I live in a small city. It has a populatioin of about 300,000 people, and it's a quiet little place which is famous for the end of the World War II. We don't have any heavy industry in my hometown, the dominant industry is agriculture.

## Q2: Is it a beautiful place?
A2: Yes, it is. There is a mountain at the north corner of the city, it has lots of trees and grass. In summer, people will pick wild mushroom and vegetable in the mountain. There is a river at the east of the city, which is the border/frontier between China and Russia. In spring, people will catch fish in the river.

## Q3: Is there anything you don't like about the city?
A3: Well, the fact that it's small, of course, means that you can't get lots of entertainment that you'd find in a big city. If you're interested in art galleries, or the symphony, it is not a good place to be. You have to drive for several hours to the big city for those kinds of things.
