Work

1. What work do you do?

I am an engineer woking at a company. I have been working there since I graduated from college in 2019. I'd like to say it is a pretty challenging job.

2. Why did you choose to do that type of job?

Because I like programming. To some degree/extent, the job demonstrates that I can solve some tough problems using my knowledge. When I accomplished a requirement through programming, it gave me a sense of achievement.

3. Do you like your job?

Definitely, I like it! I enjoy the various projects which I can take part in. Although sometimes I have to work late in my office, I feel very excited and happy when I solve a difficult problem or fix a bug in time. My job provides me with both a sense of achievement and a good salary.

I'm not interested in my job… because it is so mundane and repetitive, two traits I despise and try to stay away from. I hope to find a better job that challenges me to aspire to new heights.

4. Do you miss being a student?

Yes, of course! When I studied at the university, I didn't need to worry about anything except the exam. I miss those days when I studied my lessons at the quiet library or hung out（闲逛，出去玩） with my classmates. It's pretty memorable. Now, I have to deal with the pressure from work and family everyday.

5. Is it very interesting?

Yes, most of the time/in most cases. If you engage in a repetitive job for a long time, you may feel boring and tedious. The requirements in my job varies all the time, so I always have different tasks to complete. I need to get out of my comfort zone and learn new things, that will satisfy my curiosity and make me feel interested. 


6. Is there any kind of technology you use at work?

I need to write programme to implement the requirements in my job. I will use some programme languages like java, node, javascript to complete the tasks. There are lots of technical details in my work.

7. Can you manage your time well when you work?

Yes, each project has a deadline in my work, I need to make a schedule in order to finish my work before that time. After the review conference of the requirements, I will make a detailed plan, like what feature  I need to implement and which part I have to complete in each day. I will check the progress every morning and evening.

8. Who helps you most at work?

My colleagues in my team. There are many smart and excellent programmers in my company. Sometimes if you can't solve a tough problem after you have searched through the whole internet, you may get some inspirations or feasible advices from them.


### Hometown

1. Has your hometown changed much these years?
Absolutely. My hometown is a small city. I remember when I was a child, the city center was quiet small, there were only three main streets in the commercial district/area. However, it has constructed many tall buildings and facilities these years, even a new airport at the north area of the city.

2. Is that a big city or a small place?
My hometown is a quiet small place which has a population of about 300,000 people. There isn't any heavy industry in my hometown, the dominant industry is agriculture. The size of the city area is much smaller compared with some big cities like Beijing, but the size of farmland and forest there is quiet large.

3. How long have you been living here?
I had been living there for about 18 years until I went to university. After I graduated from school, I found a job in Beijing and I have been living here since then.

4. For you, what benefits are there living in a big city? 
There are many advantages living in a big city. For example, there are more opportunities for job-hunting here, and the quality of education and health care is much better than small cities. I think that is the main reason why a large number of young peope are flooding to big cities nowadays.

5. Is there anything you dislike about it?
Well, the fact that it's small, of course, means that you can't get lots of entertainment that you'd find in a big city. If you're interested in art galleries, or the symphony, it is not a good place to be. You have to drive for several hours to the big city for those kinds of things.

6. What do you like most about your hometown? 
The scenery and fresh air, I would say. There are many small mountains in the city, which are covered with trees and grasses. In summer, people will pick wild mushrooms and vegetables in the mountain. There is a river at the east of the city, which is the border/frontier between China and Russia. In spring, people will catch fish in the river.

7. Where in your country do you live?
I live in Beijing, the political and cultural center of the country. It is so big that you would spend hours commuting to work if you live far away from your workplace. As a result of this, you have to get up early every morning at weekdays.
