## Where do you usually watch TV programmes?
I think nowadays I hardly ever watch live TV on the actually TV set. I always watch them on my phone or laptop rather than watching TV at home. Because it's much more convenient, I can watch the shows wherever I want, totally commercial free, which of course is another important advantage.

## What's your favorite TV programme?
My favorite TV programme is some teleplays about history or people's daily life. I always choose a good teleplay on some rating websites according to the comments. For example, I like watching a historic teleplay about Ming Dynasty recently.

## Are there any programmes you don't like watching?
Well, I don't like watching soaps which is boring and has so many episodes. I think if you choose to watch them you just waste your time. However, my mum enjoy watching some soaps in her leisure time. I like some historic teleplay, and you can learn about the life and culture at that time. 

## Do you think you will watch more or fewer TV or fewer TV programmes?
I'd like to say fewer. Because I have many things to do in my daily life. In my leisure time, I'd like spending time on my hobbies, like playing guitar, reading or travelling. But I don't think I could quit it since if I did, I may miss some good programmes.
