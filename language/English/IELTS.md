### Listening Practice
1. Silent shadowing is more efficient than shadowing.
2. Pay attention to problematic parts and what you do not understand(20%), and it will save your 80% time. Then continue your extensive listening.
3. Spaced repetition only works when the way you repeat is active instead of passive, which means you have to test yourself all the time.

### Listening Test Tips
1. For completing, read the title and subtitle to get the structure, then read the key words.
2. For making choice, read the questions first, then read the choices

### Reading Test Tips
1. Read the title to learn about the theme.
2. Read the first 2 questions in each group of the passage. 
3. Read the passage and answer the corresponding question step by step.

### Writing Practice
1. Memorize vocabulary, collocation and sentence structure clearly, or it will cost you so much time to recollect and choose the suitable expression that you can not finish the test on time.
2. Learn the structure and cohesion from the model essay or some good essay.

### Writing Test Tips
1. Pay attention to the four parts of the exam indicator, task response, vocabulary, coherence and cohesion, grammar, which denotes you should answer the question according to these standards.
2. Do not use the unsuitable vocabulary, collocation or structure in your answer. In another word, you should choose proper expression in your essay.
3. Do not make any mistakes.

### Speaking Practice 
Here are some steps that you could follow when practising for the speaking test: 
1. Choose a real speaking test from one of the Cambridge books. 
2. Record yourself answering one or all of the parts of the test. 
3. Listen to the recording and transcribe it (write down everything you said). 
4. Analyse the transcript. How could your answers be improved? 
5. Take some time to prepare better answers for the same questions. 
6. Try the same questions again! Record yourself, transcribe and analyse. 
7. Repeat the process a few times until you are happy. 


### PDCA
1. Find out what or which skill you need to achieve your goal and how to improve it. 
2. Make a specific plan
3. Do it
4. Checking is the most important part for you, which means you need to figure out your weakness. You must find the root of this problem, then you can solve it fundamentally.
5. Adjust your plan. Itâ€™s feedback to the cycle.


I think there are two main points in learning language. One is input, another is output. For input, there are two skills you need to practice, reading and listening. For output, you need to practice writing and speaking. Language is composed by vocabulary, collocation, structure and grammar. You need to recognize and understand the input information. Meanwhile, you have to remember and understand the ingredients of language. Obviously, output is more difficult than input, because it will cost more time to remember than recognition.

You will find out which skill you need to practice more through testing. Then according to this situation and your goal, make a specific plan, doing, checking, adjusting(PDCA). Doing enables you to be familiar with it, while adjusting means changing your goal and plan reasonably and properly by checking. You will improve your skill bit by bit through executing this cycle continually and approach your goal step by step. 

In addition, you should set a deadline, or you probably waste your time.
