## Foreign visitors should pay more than local visitors for cultural and historical attractions. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?

It is sometimes argued that tourists from overseas should be charged more than local residents to visit important sites and monuments. I completely disagree with this idea.

The argument in favour of higher prices for foreign tourists would be that cultural or historical attractions often depend on state subsidies to keep them going, which means that the resident population already pays money to these sites through the tax system. However, I believe this to be a very shortsighted view. Foreign tourists contribute to the economy of the host country with the money they spend on a wide range of goods and services, including food, souvenirs, accommodation and travel. The governments and inhabitants of every country should be happy to subsidise important tourist sites and encourage people from the rest of the world to visit them. If travellers realised that they would have to pay more to visit historical and cultural attractions in a particular nation, they would perhaps decide not to go to that country on holiday. 

To take the UK as an example, the tourism industry and many related jobs rely on visitors coming to the country to see places like Windsor Castle or Saint Paul’s Cathedral. These two sites charge the same price regardless of nationality, and this helps to promote the nation’s cultural heritage. If overseas tourists stopped coming due to higher prices, there would be a risk of insufficient funding for the maintenance of these important buildings.

In conclusion, I believe that every effort should be made to attract tourists from overseas, and it would be counterproductive to make them pay more than local residents.

### Revised version:
It is a commonly debated topic whether tourists from overseas should pay higher fees compared to local residents when visiting significant sites and monuments. Personally, I strongly disagree with this notion.

Some argue that cultural and historical attractions heavily rely on government subsidies, which are already funded by the resident population through taxes. However, I consider this perspective to be short-sighted. Foreign tourists contribute to the economy of the host country through their spending on various goods and services, including food, accommodations, souvenirs, and transportation. It is the responsibility of governments and citizens to support these important tourist sites and actively encourage visitors from around the world to experience them. Imposing higher fees on foreign tourists may dissuade potential travelers from choosing a particular country as their holiday destination.

For instance, let us consider the United Kingdom, where the tourism industry and numerous job opportunities are reliant on visitors coming to explore renowned landmarks such as Windsor Castle and Saint Paul’s Cathedral. These iconic sites charge the same admission fees regardless of one’s nationality, contributing to the promotion of the nation’s cultural heritage. Implementing differential pricing based on nationality could undermine the funding required for the maintenance of these significant structures.

In conclusion, I firmly believe that every effort should be made to attract and welcome tourists from overseas, and it would be counterproductive to subject them to higher fees compared to local residents. It is crucial to promote inclusivity, cultural exchange, and the preservation of shared heritage. Therefore, differentiating prices based on nationality should be strongly rejected.
