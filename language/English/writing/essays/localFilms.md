## Many people prefer to watch foreign films rather than locally produced films. Why could this be? Should governments give more financial support to local film industries?

It is true that foreign films are more popular in many countries than domestically produced films. There could be several reasons why this is the case, and I believe that governments should promote local film-making by subsidising the industry.

There are various reasons why many people find foreign films more enjoyable than the films produced in their own countries. Firstly, the established film industries in certain countries have huge budgets for action, special effects and to shoot scenes in spectacular locations. Hollywood blockbusters like ‘Avatar’ or the James Bond films are examples of such productions and the global appeal that they have. Another reason why these big-budget films are so successful is that they often star the most famous actors and actresses, and they are made by the most accomplished producers and directors. The poor quality, low-budget filmmaking in many countries suffers in comparison.

In my view, governments should support local film industries financially. In every country, there may be talented amateur film-makers who just need to be given the opportunity to prove themselves. To compete with big-budget productions from overseas, these people need money to pay for film crews, actors and a host of other costs related to producing high-quality films. If governments did help with these costs, they would see an increase in employment in the film industry, income from film sales, and perhaps even a rise in tourist numbers. New Zealand, for example, has seen an increase in tourism related to the 'Lord of the Rings' films, which were partly funded by government subsidies.

In conclusion, I believe that increased financial support could help to raise the quality of locally made films and allow them to compete with the foreign productions that currently dominate the market.

### Revised version
It is undeniable that foreign films tend to enjoy greater popularity in many countries compared to domestically produced films. This can be attributed to several factors, and in my opinion, it is crucial for governments to provide increased financial support to their local film industries as a means of promoting their growth and development.

There are various reasons why individuals often find foreign films more captivating than those originating from their own country. Firstly, certain countries with established film industries have substantially higher budgets earmarked for elaborate action sequences, dazzling special effects, and filming in awe-inspiring locations. Hollywood blockbusters like 'Avatar' and the James Bond series exemplify such productions, renowned for their global appeal and grandeur. Additionally, these high-budget films frequently feature the most prominent actors, actresses, producers, and directors, further contributing to their success. In contrast, the resource limitations of low-budget filmmaking in many countries pale in comparison.

From my perspective, it is imperative for governments to extend financial support to their local film industries. Within each country, there is undoubtedly a pool of exceptionally talented amateur filmmakers awaiting the opportunity to showcase their skills and creativity. In order to effectively compete with high-budget foreign productions, these individuals require financial assistance to cover essential expenses such as skilled film crews, talented actors, and various other costs associated with producing high-quality films. By offering financial aid, governments would not only stimulate job creation within the film industry but also generate increased revenue from film sales. Furthermore, it is conceivable that the promotion of local films could even have a positive effect on tourism, as exemplified by New Zealand's experience with the 'Lord of the Rings' films, partially financed through government subsidies.

In conclusion, enhanced financial support plays a pivotal role in elevating the quality of locally made films and enabling them to compete with dominant foreign productions in the market. By allocating resources to bolster local film industries, governments can foster the growth of talent, enhance the overall standard of films, and create a more equitable and thriving film industry for the benefit of all.
