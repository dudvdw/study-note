## Many museums charge for admission while others are free. Do you think the advantages of charging people for admission to museums outweigh the disadvantages?

There is a debate about whether museums should charge people for admission. In my view, there are more negative impacts for museums to charge people for admission.

Museums are used for exhibiting and preserving our culture and history which are indispensable and the foremost for one nationality. If the museums charge for admission, people are reluctant to visit them and try to know the culture and history of the nation. Lack of knowing and identifying for the culture and history, people will not have the sense of belonging and be unwilling to make a contributions to preserve the culture and history. Furthermore, unsufficient attention to the culture and history may result in lacking confidence and faith to solve potential problems and the crises collaboratively.

In addition, charging for admission may have an adverse impact on economy and globalisation. Even though charging people for admission can bring an amount of revenue for the museum, it may reduce the revenue for other industries. Because of charging for admission, visitors are unlikely to visit the area near the museum which means that the tourism revenue will decrease correspondingly. Moreover, foreigners do not know much about the nations' culture and history, seldom will they have the motivation and desire to communicate with local people and build relationship with them. That will become an obstacle to the globalisation and the influences the diplomatic relationships with other countries.

In conclusion, there are many drawbacks and disadvantages for museums to charge for admission, although it may bring some profits to them. The museums should consider the benefits and influences from a wide and long view instead of merely calculating their revenue coming from charging for the admission.

## Revised version

Museums play a crucial role in preserving and showcasing a nation’s culture and history. The question of whether museums should charge for admission has sparked a debate. In my opinion, the disadvantages of charging for admission outweigh the advantages.

On one hand, museums are invaluable sources of knowledge and should be easily accessible to everyone. Charging an entrance fee might deter people from visiting, limiting their exposure to the nation’s culture and heritage. Without a deep understanding of their own history, people may fail to develop a sense of belonging and may be less motivated to contribute to the preservation of their culture. Moreover, neglecting cultural and historical education can lead to a lack of confidence in solving potential problems collectively, resulting in a weakened sense of national identity.

Additionally, charging for admission can have adverse effects on local economies and global relations. Though museum fees generate revenue for the institution, they can hinder the growth of other industries. Visitors who pay for museum entry may be less likely to explore nearby areas, leading to a decrease in tourism revenue. Moreover, foreigners with limited knowledge of the country’s culture may lack motivation to interact with locals, hindering global communication and potentially straining diplomatic relationships.

In conclusion, while charging for admission may provide some financial benefits to museums, I believe the negative consequences are more significant. Museums should consider the broader and long-term impacts, rather than focusing solely on revenue generation. To foster a sense of cultural appreciation and encourage global understanding, museums should remain accessible to all without imposing financial barriers.
