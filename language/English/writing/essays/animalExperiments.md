## Nowadays animal experiments are widely used to develop new medicines and to test the safety of other products. Some people argue that these experiments should be banned because it is morally wrong to cause animals to suffer, while others are in favour of them because of their benefits to humanity.Discuss both views and give your own opinion.


It is true that medicines and other products are routinely tested on animals before they are cleared for human use. While I tend towards the viewpoint that animal testing is morally wrong, I would have to support a limited amount of animal experimentation for the development of medicines.

On the one hand, there are clear ethical arguments against animal experimentation. To use a common example of this practice, laboratory mice may be given an illness so that the effectiveness of a new drug can be measured. Opponents of such research argue that humans have no right to subject animals to this kind of trauma, and that the lives of all creatures should be respected. They believe that the benefits to humans do not justify the suffering caused, and that scientists should use alternative methods of research.

On the other hand, reliable alternatives to animal experimentation may not always be available. Supporters of the use of animals in medical research believe that a certain amount of suffering on the part of mice or rats can be justified if human lives are saved. They argue that opponents of such research might feel differently if a member of their own families needed a medical treatment that had been developed through the use of animal experimentation. Personally, I agree with the banning of animal testing for non-medical products, but I feel that it may be a necessary evil where new drugs and medical procedures are concerned.

In conclusion, it seems to me that it would be wrong to ban testing on animals for vital medical research until equally effective alternatives have been developed.

## Revised Essay:

It is widely acknowledged that animal experiments play a crucial role in the development of new medicines and safety testing of various products. The morality surrounding this practice is a subject of debate. While I lean towards the belief that animal testing is morally questionable, I do recognize the importance of limited animal experimentation specifically for medical advancements.

On the one hand, there are strong ethical arguments against animal experimentation. For instance, laboratory mice are often intentionally inflicted with diseases to assess the effectiveness of new drugs. Critics assert that humans have no right to subject animals to such suffering, emphasizing the need for respect towards all living beings. They contend that the benefits derived from animal testing do not justify the cruelty involved and advocate for alternative research methods.

On the other hand, it is important to acknowledge that feasible alternatives to animal experimentation may not always be available. Supporters argue that the potential to save human lives justifies the minimal suffering of mice or rats. They suggest that opponents may have a change of heart if their own family members were in dire need of medical treatment developed through animal experimentation. Personally, while I endorse the prohibition of animal testing for non-medical purposes, I believe it may be a necessary evil when it comes to the development of new drugs and medical procedures.

In conclusion, it is my opinion that a complete ban on animal testing for essential medical research should only be implemented once equally effective alternatives have been thoroughly developed and established.
