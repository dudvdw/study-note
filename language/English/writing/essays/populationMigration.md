## In many countries around the world, rural people are moving to cities, so the population in the countryside is decreasing. Do you think this is positive or a negative development?

Nowadays, people have different opinions about whether the phenomenon of rural people moving to urban area is a positive change. In my opinion, urbanisation is a beneficial process to both individuals and the country.

Although there are several issues left because of the process of urbanisation, it is still a positive development to everyone. Comparing to the rural area, the population density of the city is much higher. Therefore, the cost of all sorts of infrastructure is rather low when it is divided into per person. Besides, the urban area is suitable to develop intensive industries which rely heavily on significant numbers of labour. It is definite that individual can tap into their talent and get promotion in such a competitive environment.

Some people may argue that the urbanisation may lead to brain drain and the the elder people without caring. Due to higher salary and more job opportunities, young people prefer to work and live in cities. In fact, it is a normal phenomenon resulting from less demand for high talented people in rural area. The farm work can be accomplished efficiently with fewer people because of the agricultural machines and vehicles. On the other hand, young people can bring their parents to live with them in cities where has a better environment and high quality of healthcare. Furthermore, the public transportation is more convenient than before for people to travel between the cities and their hometowns.

In conclusion, urbanisation has a positive impact on people's life. I believe we can solve these issues effectively and successfully resulted from this process.

Nowadays, there are differing opinions on whether the movement of rural inhabitants to urban areas constitutes a positive change. In my viewpoint, urbanization is a constructive development that brings benefits to both individuals and the nation as a whole.

Revised Body Paragraph 1:
Despite the challenges posed by urbanization, I consider it to be a positive development overall (1). Notably, cities exhibit a higher population density in comparison to rural areas, which leads to lower costs per capita for various infrastructure projects (2). This efficient allocation of resources ensures that individuals can avail themselves of cost-effective transportation, healthcare, and educational facilities (3). Moreover, urban areas are highly conducive to the growth of intensive industries that heavily rely on a substantial labor force, offering individuals the opportunity to showcase their talents and excel in a competitive environment (4).

Revised Body Paragraph 2:
Critics argue that urbanization leads to brain drain and neglect of the elderly (5). However, it is essential to recognize that the allure of higher salaries and abundant job opportunities is a natural incentive for young people to relocate to cities (6). Additionally, the advancements in agricultural machinery have significantly reduced the demand for highly skilled labor in rural areas, leading to greater efficiency in farm work (7). Moreover, young individuals migrating to urban areas often have the means to bring their parents along, resulting in improved living standards and access to high-quality healthcare facilities (8). Furthermore, the availability of efficient public transportation systems facilitates convenient travel between cities and hometowns, strengthening familial bonds and support networks (9).

Revised Conclusion:
In conclusion, urbanization has a positive impact on the lives of individuals (10). I firmly believe that the challenges arising from this process can be effectively addressed and overcome, resulting in successful outcomes for all stakeholders involved.

## Revised version 2

Rural-urban migration is a common trend in many countries, raising debates regarding its impact on rural areas. However, I firmly believe that rural-urban migration brings numerous benefits to both individuals and the country as a whole.

Body Paragraph 1: Improved Opportunities and Infrastructure
Rural-urban migration offers individuals improved economic opportunities and access to better infrastructure. In urban areas, a higher population density allows for more efficient allocation of resources, resulting in reduced costs per capita for essential services such as transportation, healthcare, and education. Moreover, urban settings provide ideal environments for the development of intensive industries that require a substantial labor force. This creates a competitive atmosphere where individuals can tap into their full potential and achieve professional growth.

Body Paragraph 2: Enhanced Quality of Life and Cultural Exchange
Another advantage of rural-urban migration is the enhanced quality of life and the promotion of cultural exchange. In cities, individuals have access to better living standards, including improved healthcare facilities, education, and recreational activities. Furthermore, migration to urban areas fosters cultural diversity and exchange as people from different backgrounds come together. This promotes mutual understanding, appreciation, and the enrichment of societal values.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, rural-urban migration brings a multitude of benefits to individuals and society as a whole. The improved opportunities and infrastructure in urban areas create an environment conducive to personal and professional growth. Additionally, the enhanced quality of life and cultural exchange add value to society by fostering understanding and diversity. While challenges may accompany this trend, it is crucial to embrace the positive impacts of rural-urban migration and continue minimizing any potential drawbacks. By doing so, we can create a harmonious and prosperous society for all.
