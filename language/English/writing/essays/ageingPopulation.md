## In many countries, people are now living longer than ever before. Some people say an ageing population creates problems for governments. Other people think there are benefits if society has more elderly people. To what extent do the advantages of having an ageing population outweigh the disadvantages?

There is an increasing trend among many countries nowadays that people have a longer lifespan than before. People have different opinions about whether ageing population benefits the society. In my opinion, ageing population have more advantages than disadvantages to our society.

Some people argue that the ageing population creates problems for governments, such as health care and pension. I suppose that the elderly people can have positive impacts on our economy and society. By delaying retirement, the elderly people can make great contributions to our economy because of their sufficient experiences and sophisticated skills. In addition, they can impart their valuable expertise and knowledge to young generation through their work or some training courses. In this way, the elderly people can create huge economic value and positive impacts to the society.

Furthermore, the elderly people are able to contribute to the culture and history in a profound way. Possessing affluent life experiences and a long view of the society,  elderly people have a deep comprehension to our culture. Some invaluable traditional skills and crafts can only be inherited from generation to generation through the efforts of the older generation. Otherwise, this traditional culture will disappear in some moment of the history. Moreover, the elderly people have more knowledge about our contemporary history, so they can attend voluntary activities in some historical museums to explain the details of some specific periods in history.

In conclusion, the elderly people are conducive to our society, economy, culture and history due to their priceless expertise and experiences which outweigh the challenges and issues they bring to the government and the society.


### Revised version:

There is an ongoing increase in lifespans across many countries, leading to a growing population of elderly individuals. Opinions vary regarding the positive and negative implications of an ageing population on society. In my view, the benefits of having more elderly people outweigh the potential drawbacks.

Some individuals argue that an ageing population poses challenges for governments, particularly/specifically in the areas of healthcare and pension provision. However, I believe that elderly people can have a positive influence on our economy and society. By choosing to prolong their working lives, older individuals can make significant contributions to the economy due to their extensive experience and advanced skills. Additionally, they can share their valuable expertise and knowledge with younger generations through their work or by offering training courses. Consequently, the elderly have the potential to create substantial economic value and contribute positively to society as a whole. (This not only generates economic value but also has a positive impact on society as a whole.)

Furthermore, the elderly can make profound contributions to our culture and history. Through their rich life experiences and comprehensive understanding of society, they possess a deep appreciation for our cultural heritage. Some invaluable traditional skills and crafts can only be passed down from one generation to another through the efforts of older individuals. Without their involvement, these traditional cultural practices may eventually disappear. Moreover, older individuals possess a wealth of knowledge about our recent history, which enables them to actively engage in voluntary activities at historical museums, offering detailed insights into specific periods.

To conclude, the benefits of an ageing population outweigh any challenges they may present to governments and society. The expertise and experiences of older individuals are invaluable and positively impact our economy, culture, and history. It is important to recognize and appreciate the immeasurable value that older generations bring to our society.
