Humanity has survived on earth for a long time and dominates the planet with the help of science. From our current perspective, we are willing to improve our lives on varied aspects. However, we should consider to use science to fulfil more goals, because we are confronting so many problems nowadays, such as energy crisis, global warming, regional conflicts and so on. We need to take positive measures to deal with these issues and science is an effective and useful tool for us to find a feasible and practical way. For example, some space exploration programmes launched by spaceX and NASA may become a good start point to solve part of these problems.

Furthermore, there are a wide range of species coexisting with us on the planet. Therefore, we should now not merely pay attention to our own interests without taking other creatures into consideration.

## Revised version

Many people consider the primary objective of science to be the improvement of human life. While this is undoubtedly a crucial goal, I believe that science should encompass broader aims.

Throughout history, humankind has flourished and exerted dominion over the planet by harnessing the power of science. While our current focus is on enhancing various aspects of our lives, we must not limit scienceâ€™s potential to solely this purpose. In the face of contemporary challenges such as the energy crisis, global warming, and regional conflicts, we need to leverage scientific advancements to address these issues effectively. Science serves as a valuable and effective tool in finding feasible and practical solutions. For instance, initiatives such as space exploration programs led by SpaceX and NASA have laid a solid foundation for addressing some of these problems.

Furthermore, our planet is host to a wide range of species apart from humans. Neglecting the well-being of other creatures in favor of our own interests is shortsighted. Protecting other species not only benefits them but also contributes to our own development and survival. By employing scientific methods to improve our environment and safeguard biodiversity, we can coexist harmoniously with other species for a much longer time.

In conclusion, science undoubtedly plays a key role in offering us a better and more comfortable life. However, we must also consider the future and destiny of other species. Taking a holistic approach is crucial, as it not only benefits all current inhabitants of the planet but also ensures the well-being of future generations.
