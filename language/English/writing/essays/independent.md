## Some people think that in the modern world we are more dependent on each other, while others think that people have become more independent. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.

People have different views about whether we are more or less dependent on others nowadays. In my view, modern life forces us to be more independent than people were in the past.

There are two main reasons why it could be argued that we are more dependent on each other now. Firstly, life is more complex and difficult, especially because the cost of living has increased so dramatically. For example, young adults tend to rely on their parents for help when buying a house. Property prices are higher than ever, and without help it would be impossible for many people to pay a deposit and a mortgage. Secondly, people seem to be more ambitious nowadays, and they want a better quality of life for their families. This means that both parents usually need to work full-time, and they depend on support from grandparents and babysitters for child care.

However, I would agree with those who believe that people are more independent these days. In most countries, families are becoming smaller and more dispersed, which means that people cannot count on relatives as much as they used to. We also have more freedom to travel and live far away from our home towns. For example, many students choose to study abroad instead of going to their local university, and this experience makes them more independent as they learn to live alone. Another factor in this growing independence is technology, which allows us to work alone and from any part of the world.

In conclusion, while there are some reasons to believe that people now depend on each other more, my own view is that we are more independent than ever.
 

### Revised version
People’s perceptions regarding whether modern society has made us more dependent or independent differ significantly. In my view, the intricacies of contemporary existence necessitate a greater sense of self-sufficiency than in the past. This essay will thoroughly explore both perspectives before substantiating why increased independence is the prevailing trend.

Dependency Arguments:
The essay addresses the fact that life has become increasingly complex, and the accompanying rise in the cost of living has left many individuals dependent on their parents for financial assistance. However, these circumstances have been further exemplified by the mounting property prices, making it nearly impossible for individuals to afford a down payment and mortgage without such support. Another point raised is the ambition and aspirations of people in today’s society, which demand a higher quality of life for their families. This, in turn, necessitates full-time employment for both parents, leading to a reliance on external help such as grandparents and babysitters for childcare.

Independence Arguments:
Conversely, it is important to acknowledge that families today are smaller and more dispersed, diminishing the level of reliance on extended family members compared to the past. Furthermore, the freedom to travel and study abroad has considerably eliminated individuals’ reliance on their local communities, promoting self-sufficiency. A mention of technological advancements is made, underscoring their impact in enabling individuals to work autonomously from anywhere in the world, thereby fostering a sense of independence.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, while there are plausible arguments supporting the notion that modern society has made people more dependent on one another, the essay’s standpoint is firmly grounded in the belief that we are now more independent than ever before. This is attributed to various factors such as smaller and dispersed families, the freedom to travel and study abroad, as well as advancements in technology.
